            I consider myself an all-rounder. What defines me is my passion and drive to learn whatever is needed to get the job done the right way.
            </p>
            <p>
              My most proficient programming languages are JavaScript and C#. I've done my fair share of Frontend work, built mobile apps,
              deployed APIs that get used by teams across the globe, and ran too many `DELETE` statements without a `WHERE` clause.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            Sharing what I know is one of my favorite things, that is why Iâ€™m
            usually involved in tasks like mentoring, giving workshops and
            driving interviews. I was part of the organizing team of the .NET meetup in Montevideo, 
            and I'm currently organizing the Montevideo JS meetup, racking up around a dozen events yearly.
